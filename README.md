# OmniAuth XING

This gem contains the XING strategy for OmniAuth.

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 1.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile` along side omniauth:

    gem 'omniauth'
    gem 'omniauth-xing'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :xing, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with XING.
